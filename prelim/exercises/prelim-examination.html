                        The preliminary examination tested not only what I learned from the lectures but also my ability to apply them in practical contexts. The questions required me to explain my experiences and practical application during the exercises, particularly in identifying which categories were often incorrectly classified by the model and explaining why the model failed to classify them correctly. This gave me the chance to reflect on the different factors that may have influenced the errors, such as limited training data, overlapping categories that confused the model, or cases where preprocessing steps were not enough to clean the data properly. By analyzing these mistakes, I was able to understand clearly how important both data quality and preprocessing in achieving accurate model.

                    <li>
                        Another important part of the exam focused on the relationship between text preprocessing and text representation. In my answer, I explained why text preprocessing should performed first before doing text representation, in this step where we clean and standardize raw data by removing noise, lowercasing, stopword removal, special character removal, and tokenization, which makes the input more consistent and easier to process. On the other hand, text representation transform cleaned data into numerical form or known as numerical representation using techniques One-Hot Encoding, Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings, so it becomes easier for machine learning algorithms to understand and process it. Through this, I was able to demonstrate how these two crucial processes are connected.

                        Additionally, the last question that gives me a hard time because I struggled to  organize and structure my thoughts. Specifically, the question about what new NLP techniques  I learned in the exercises and how I used it. I admit that my answer did not fully meet the questions, since I only applied nlp techniques what Mr. Raga taught us during the lectures. Even though our professor encourages us to research further so that we donâ€™t limit our knowledge to what is provided, I relied more on lecture materials instead of extending my research. This made me realize the importance of exploring beyond the class content to strengthen my foundational knowledge and be better prepared for unexpected questions.

                    <li>
                        Overall, the exam helped me consolidate the theoretical knowledge and the practical applications I practices in laboratory exercises. It also made me realized the importance of improving how I explain my knowledge in a more organized and proper way. As well as, it served as a verification of whether I already have solid foundation knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Text preprocessing, representation, and NLP tasks. This assures me that I am better prepared for the upcoming advanced lectures in the midterm.
