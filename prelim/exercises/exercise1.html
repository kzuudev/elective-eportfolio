                            During this exercise, I studied three core areas in Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

                        <li>
                            <b>Machine Learning:</b> In my 3rd Year Second Semester, ML is a branch of AI that allows a computer to learn from the data and improve performance without explicitly programming. Businesses benefit from the application of ML because it supports companies to make smarter decision and provide optimal solutions to the business problems effectively.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Deep Learning:</b> Based on my research: It was first introduced by Rina Dechter in 1986. It’s a form of machine learning that enables computer to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of hierarchy of concept. Unlike traditional models, deep learning used a advanced artificial neural networks such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), Conventional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) that can widely used in field like image identification, pilotless driving and natural language recognition and complex problems like XOR gate. Moreover, it can also solves the issues of modern business activities, including handle vast amount of irregular data in the daily operation, extract useful information out of such data, and etc.

                        <li>
                            <b>Natural Language Processing:</b> NLP is a field of AI that integrates computational linguistics, ML, and DL to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. In real-world Applications, NLP can use to chatbots, virtual assistants, and text analytics tool, allowing business to automate customer service, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce operational costs. NLP also has the ability to process and analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, it provides businesses with deep insights into customer behavior, market trends, and operational inefficiencies, and making better decision-making.

                          In completion of this laboratory exercise, I reviewed my previous knowledge of ML and how I implement it in a real-word applications (exercises/project), especially the results and impacts of it in business decision-making. Additionally, I researched the history and application of Deep Learning, highly focused on how advanced neural networks used in advanced AI and NLP tasks. Based on the provided lectures, I explored the role of NLP in combining ML and DL to process human language.

                      <li>
                          The connection between this laboratory exercise and lectures (Deep Learning applications in Business Activities & Role of Machine Learning and their Effect on Business, the provided lecture introduced ML, DL, and NLP as theoretical foundations, while during the completion of exercises allowed me to apply this knowledge to practical scenarios. 
                      </li>
  
                      <li>
  
                          Overall, this exercise helps me to grasp the foundational knowledge of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how they interconnected to each other. Additionally, how we will apply these three in a real-world application and how businesses benefits from implementing these techniques.
