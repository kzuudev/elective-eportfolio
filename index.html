                    <b>I.</b> In 3rd Year Second Semester, I’ve already studied <b>machine learning</b> significantly, including the benefits of applying machine learning across several industries. For example, in business through machine learning it can help companies to make smarter decisions in the business processes and also able to provide solutions to the business problems effectively.

                    On the other hand, based on my research about Deep Learning, It was first introduced by Rina Dechter in 1986. It’s a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concept. Compared to any other learning algorithms, deep learning can widely used in field like image identification, pilotless driving and natural language recognition and complex problems like XOR gate. Moreover, it can also solves the issues of modern business activities, including handle vast amount of irregular data in the daily operation, extract useful information out of such data, and etc.

                <p class="expectations__text">
                    Lastly, in world of Natural Language Processing is a field of Artificial Intelligence that uses machine learning to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. By combining computational linguistics, the rule-based modeling of human language together with statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning. Moreover, In business activities through Natural Language Processing it enhanced customer service by the automation of customer service interactions, allowing for instant, 24/7 responses to customer inquiries through chatbots and virtual assistants. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also significantly reduces operational costs. It also provides Insightful data analysis, other than algorithms NLP also has the ability to process and analyze vast amounts of unstructured data, it provides businesses with deep insights into customer behaviour, market trends, and operational inefficiencies, and making better decision-making.

                    Natural Language Processing related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning to understand and process human language. Machine learning algorithms are used to train NLP models on large datasets, allowing them to recognize patterns and relationships within text and speech. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, further enhances NLP by utilizing neural networks with multiple layers to handle complex language tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation.

                <p class="expectations__text">
                    <b>II.</b>  Based on what I’ve learned about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Proccessing.there are many areas I’m excited to explore further. I’m particularly eager to learn about the various algorithms and understand how each one works, including their strengths, weaknesses, and real-world applications.On the other hand, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of advanced neural networks and how they are structured and trained to solve complex problems. I want to learn not just how to use deep learning models, but also the underlying logic and processes that make them work. Lastly, Natural Language Processing, I’m interested in exploring how machine learning helps NLP systems recognize patterns, train on large datasets, and understand relationships within text and speech. Specifically, I want to understand the **actual process of building and training NLP models**, and how deep learning enhances their performance using advanced architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers.

                <p class="expectations__text">
                    <b>III.</b>  When I was in my third year as a student, I began learning about the fundamentals of Machine Learning such as how it can support better decision-making, how to extract meaningful insights from large datasets, and how to understand and implement various algorithms like decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, regression models, and neural networks. This experience sparked my strong interest in the field and made me realize that I want to pursue a career as a Data Analyst.As I explored more, I found myself drawn to the role of a Data Analyst, someone who not only works with data but also turns it into actionable insights that drive smart decisions. The ability to transform raw data into meaningful stories and patterns truly excites me. Looking ahead, I believe the upcoming topics including advanced machine learning techniques, deep learning concepts, and natural language processing will play a crucial role in strengthening my current foundation. These topics are not only essential to my academic growth but also serve as a significant milestone in my journey to becoming a skilled and efficient Data Analyst. I'm excited to gain hands-on experience, work on real datasets, and build models that reflect the practical value of data in various industries.
